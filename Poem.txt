**The Sun's Reflection**

The sun's reflection, caught in puddles deep,
A shimmered jewel where secrets softly sleep.
It holds the sky, like canvas stretched on blue,
But ripples distort, and dreamscape paints anew.

Is this the world, reflected, fractured, strange?
Or just a fleeting glimpse, a passing change?
Does truth lie nestled in its depths unseen,
Or is it simply light, a play on mirrored sheen?

Question:- The Sun's Reflection,' the poet plays with the image of a puddle reflecting the sky. How does this image contribute to the poem's central theme? Consider elements like form, language, and symbolism in your answer.

Ideal Answer:- The puddle serves as a powerful symbol for a world filled with uncertainty and fragmented perspectives. The distorted reflection of the sky challenges us to question whether we perceive reality accurately or merely see our own projections. The use of short, choppy lines mirrors the ripples in the water, further emphasizing the fragmented nature of our experience. The poem's ambiguity, with its unanswered questions, invites us to contemplate the relationship between truth, illusion, and our own internal landscapes.
